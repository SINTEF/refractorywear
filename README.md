# Sidenor refractory wear model
Python code to model the refractory wear of a steel ladle

## Running model
pip install -r requirements.txt
python example.py
## Inputs
The inputs are all located in various input files and read using pandas. The data files contains more data than is currently used, but these data points might be useful in the future

### Time dependent inputs

Variable                   location             Description
----------                 ----------           -----------
Temperatura                \<heat number\>.gz   Measurement of temperature in steel. 
                                                First value is used as a backup if no EAF 
                                                temperature is given, all values are used 
                                                to compare the model to data
time                       \<heat number\>.gz   Preprocessed data
power                      \<heat number\>.gz   Preprocessed data
Consumo_electrico          \<heat number\>.gz   Consumed electricity, energy will go into 
                                                slag (and then steel). This will give a 
                                                temperature increase 
Caudal\_gas                \<heat number\>.gz   The gas rate is used to calculate utau, 
                                                which is used to calculate heat transfer 
                                                coefficients in steel and slag
Fechahora                  \<heat number\>.gz   Time, used to determine what happens when
Heat number                Alloys addition      Need the heat number to connect the rest of data
                           time and weights.csv
Addition time              Alloys addition      At what time additions are added, used to 
                           time and weights.csv determine when to add additions
Mass added per heat (ton)  Alloys addition      Mass of additions
                           time and weights.csv
